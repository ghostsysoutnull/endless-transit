# Housekeeping Backlog
**Purpose:** Small, bounded code-quality items that were out of scope for the phase that found them.
Each is a candidate for a standalone housekeeping commit between phases (see "clear the improvement
backlog between phases" in `tasks/lessons/infrastructure.md`). Not workflow items — those go to
`docs/analysis/WORKFLOW_BACKLOG.md`.

**Process:** Open item → pick up between phases → plan, `/grill`, execute → mark CLOSED with commit.

### HK-001 — BridgeView draws randomness outside the seed chain
**Resolution:** `FrameEntropy.forFrame(ctx)` (location LIP × 31 + player step count) seeds the spectrogram,
abyssal static, void voices, map glitch plots and the description/trace glitches; `Terminal.glitchText`
gained a seeded overload. Goldens are compared raw (mask removed) and gained 7 frames incl. five at
bedrock. `./vinc.sh --goldens` twice → identical.
**Closed:** 2026-09-11 | commits f3a3d9e (HK-001a), 4cd13c0 (HK-001b)

### HK-002 — `GameState.inventoryController` is a service in a data container
**Resolution:** `QuantumBufferController` is built once in `Game` (`game.inventoryController`); `GameState`
holds data only. **Closed:** 2026-09-11 | commit fb8f092

### HK-003 — `Game.processInput()` duplicates `NavigationCommand.execute()`
**Resolution:** `TurnProcessor.dispatch(game, choice)` is the single "global command, else navigation" path;
`handleInput` and `Game.processInput` both call it. **Closed:** 2026-09-11 | commit dc5b1aa

### HK-004 — inventory overlay had no production caller
**Resolution:** one renderer. `InventoryOverlayComponent` gained item numbers and synthesis labels (the
format `Player.listInventory()` printed); `QuantumBufferController` shows it above the drop/merge
commands; `Player.listInventory()` deleted; `QuantumBufferScreenTest` pins the screen.
**Closed:** 2026-09-11 | commit d2bb2f6

### HK-001 — BridgeView draws randomness outside the seed chain
**Found:** Phase 7 pre-grill, 2026-09-11
**Sites** (line numbers as of commit `1d3d570`; they move as components are extracted — search by method):
- `BridgeView.groovy:183` — abyssal void voices, `new Random()`
- `BridgeView.groovy:250` — `applyAbyssalStatic`, `new Random()`
- `BridgeView.groovy:354` — `generateSystemTelemetry` spectrogram, `new Random(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000)`
- `BridgeView.groovy:556` — `renderLatticeMap` glitch at coherence < 30, `new Random()`
**Effect:** Same seed + same inputs ≠ same frame. `BridgeViewGoldenFrameTest` must mask the
spectrogram and cannot pin abyssal or low-coherence frames at all.
**Fix candidate:** seed from the game clock tick or `masterLocus.nextRandom()` (procgen law:
"Deterministic Component Engines"), then unmask the spectrogram and add abyssal goldens.
**Constraint:** Do NOT fix inside Phase 7 — zero behavior change. Pick up after Phase 7 merges.

### HK-002 — `GameState.inventoryController` is a service in a data container
**Found:** Phase 6 retro (`docs/retro/RETRO_PHASE_6.md`, "Concerns"). Candidate move:
`QuantumBufferController` → `TurnProcessor` or `Game`. No caller confusion today.

### HK-003 — `Game.processInput()` duplicates `NavigationCommand.execute()`
**Found:** Phase 6 retro. Both resolve a choice, bump `stepCount`, record it, call the closure.
Test-only path. Candidate: delegate one to the other.

### HK-004 — `BridgeView.renderInventoryOverlay` (now `InventoryOverlayComponent`) has no production caller
**Found:** Phase 7f pre-grill, 2026-09-11. The `i` command opens `QuantumBufferController.open()`, which
prints its own `[QUANTUM_TRACE_BUFFER_INTERACE]` screen; the `[QUANTUM_TRACE_BUFFER_SYNC...]` overlay is
reached only by the golden harness (frames 07, 19). Product decision: wire the overlay into the buffer
command (it is the richer render — signal bars and phase) or retire it and its two goldens. Not a
Phase 7 change (zero behavior change).
